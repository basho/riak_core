%% NOTES:
%% The background manager allows tokens and locks to be "acquired" by
%% competing processes in a way that limits the total load on the cluster.
%%
%% The model is different than your typical semaphore. Here, we are
%% interested in coordinating background jobs that start, run, and die.
%% 
%%
%% The term "given" is a general version of "held", "acquired", or
%% "allocated" for both locks and tokens. Held doesn't make sense for
%% tokens since they aren't held. So, "given" applies to both locks
%% and tokens, but you can think "held" for locks if that's more fun.
%%
%% Resources are defined by their "names", which is the same as "type"
%% or "kind". A lock name might be the atom 'aae_hashtree_lock' or the
%% tuple '{my_ultimate_lock, 42}'.
%%
%% Usage:
%% 1. register your lock/token and set it's max concurrency/rate.
%% 2. "get" a lock/token by it's resource type/name
%% 3. do stuff
%% 4. let your process die, which gives back a lock.
