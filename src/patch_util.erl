%% Each patched beam should have a compile-time directive (termed a
%% module attribute or pragma) with a proplist including one or more
%% of the following keys:
%%

%% MANDATORY (although not really enforceable)

%%   name          Atom that uniquely describes this patch. If a patch is
%%                 compiled differently for multiple OTP/Riak
%%                 environments each should have a different name,
%%                 like disable_sslv3_r15 and disable_sslv3_r16.
%%
%%                 If multiple modules are updated for the same fix
%%                 the name should be the same in each.

%% OPTIONAL (but desirable)

%%   version       Patch version as an integer. This should be incremented
%%                 each time a patch is compiled/delivered to any
%%                 outside party. (Ideally it should be 1 for all
%%                 patches, but computers happen.)
%%
%%                 If missing, assumed to be 1.

%%   description   Something to make it trivial to discern the purpose of
%%                 this patch

%%   tickets       A list of ticket identifiers with more detail

%%   otp_target    An OTP release identifier appropriate to this patch
