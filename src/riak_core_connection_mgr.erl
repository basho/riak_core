%% Connection manager strategy (per Jon M.)
%% when a connection request comes in,
%% + call the locator service to get the list of {transport, {address, port}}
%% + create a linked helper process to call riak_core_connection (just once) on the next available
%%   connection (ignore blacklisted ones, they'll get picked up if a repeat is necessary)
%% + on connection it transfers control of the socket back to the connmgr, casts a success message back
%%   to the connection manager and exits normally.
%%   - on success, the connection manager increments successful connects, reset the backoff timeout on
%%     that connection.
%%   - on failure, casts a failure message back to the connection manager (error, timeout etc) the
%%     connection manager marks the {Transport, {Address, Port}} as blacklisted, increases the failure
%%     counter and starts a timer for the backoff time (and updates it for next time). The connection
%%     manager checks for the next non--blacklisted endpoint in the connection request list to launch
%%     a new connection, if the list is empty call the locator service again to get a new list. If all
%%     connections are blacklisted, use send_after message to wake up and retry (perhaps with backoff
%%     time too).

%% End-point status state, updated for failed and successful connection attempts,
%% or by timers that fire to update the backoff time.
