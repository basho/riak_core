# Riak Core

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/basho/riak_core.png)](http://travis-ci.org/basho/riak_core)

Riak Core is the distributed systems framework that forms the basis of
how [Riak](http://github.com/basho/riak) distributes data and scales.
More generally, it can be thought of as a toolkit for building
distributed, scalable, fault-tolerant applications.

For some introductory reading on Riak Core (that’s not pure code),
there’s an old but still valuable
[blog post on the Basho Blog](http://basho.com/where-to-start-with-riak-core/)
that’s well worth your time.
